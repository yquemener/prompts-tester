Make a flask app that implements a basic dungeon crawler and populate it with rooms, monsters and treasures.

The app should propose buttons to go N S E W. It should describe the room the player is in, and what it sees, treasures and monsters.

It should have a combat system, display the user's life points and describe the current room.

The data for the game can be stored in a sqlite database. The DB is named playground.db.


---
Remember that you can only send one SQL request at the time.

---
Regenerate the python file

---
Nice, but I don't see any buttons to do any actions (go N S E W, fight monster, pick up treasure). I also don't see my health points


---
The buttons don't trigger any action. Update the python file.

---
Implement the actions. Store the current position of the user in the database.
